# D-Lab R Fundamentals introductory workshop series  
This is the repository for D-Lab's introductory R-Fundamentals workshop series. Laptop, Internet connection, and Zoom account required.

# Download and install R and RStudio

To install R to use locally on your own machine, follow these instructions:

1) [Download and install R](https://cloud.r-project.org/)  
2) [Download and install RStudio Desktop Open Source License FREE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)  

# Download workshop materials to get started

To prepare ahead of time for attending this workhsop, download the [R-Fundamentals workshop materials](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/R-Fundamentals).
To run the lessons from the workshop materials on your laptop:

1) Click the green “Code” button above (top-right) 
2) Select “[Download ZIP](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/R-Fundamentals/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)”  
3) Find the downloaded .zip file and extract it to some place convenient (i.e., Desktop)
4) Open these materials in R Studio from the location you extracted the files

> (Optionally) If you are a Git user, simply clone this repository by opening a terminal and typing: `git clone git@github.com:dlab-berkeley/R-Fundamentals.git`

# Is RStudio not working on your laptop? 

You can also access RStudio through your browser on UC Berkeley's DataHub by clicking [this link](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdlab-berkeley%2FR-Fundamentals&urlpath=rstudio%2F&branch=master). Datahub is a great option if you aren't able to install R and RStudio locally. CalNet ID credentials required. 

# Workshop goals
There are four code files in this repository that we will walk through. The following topics will be covered:

**Part1.R** - Introduction to R, navigating RStudio, variable assignment, data types and coercion, data structures  
**Part2.R** - Import, subset, and merge data; identify missing data  
**Part3.R** - Research design, data summarization and visualization, statistical testing  
**Part4.R** - For-loops, custom functions, basic automation

# Start running the code!
**Open the file "Part1.R" to begin.** Place your cursor on a line of runnable code (lines without hashtags preceding them) and click the "Run" button or press Ctrl + Enter (PC) or command + Enter (Mac) to run a line of code. The output will appear in the "Console" section of RStudio. 

# About the UC Berkeley D-Lab
D-Lab works with Berkeley faculty, research staff, and students to advance data-intensive social science and humanities research. Our goal at D-Lab is to provide practical training, staff support, resources, and space to enable you to use R for your own research applications. Our services cater to all skill levels and no programming, statistical, or computer science backgrounds are necessary. We offer these services in the form of workshops such as R Fundamentals, one-to-one consulting, and working groups that cover a variety of research topics, digital tools, and programming languages.
